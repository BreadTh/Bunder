Bunder is an easy way to set up a common scenario set of queues and exchanges for a low traffic retry module in RabbitMQ and connect to them.
It features logs of what went through the main queue as well as logs of rejects and delayed retries (which required [rabbitmq delayed message exchanges](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange))
